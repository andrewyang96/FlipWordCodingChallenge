# FlipWordCodingChallenge

### Data Challenge:

Parse a large string to extract all sentences

Using a list of words ordered by 'difficulty', select sentences which contain the word at and closest to one index of the list. Prefer words that come before the index

Bonus: Make it somewhat efficient

A hardcoded list of words and document of sentences is fine

### My Assumptions:

The word list is restricted to the [10000 most common English words](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).

Difficulty is proportional to word length.

The text to be analyzed is the first chapter of 1984.
